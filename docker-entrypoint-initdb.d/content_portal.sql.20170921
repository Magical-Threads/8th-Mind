Gygax developed a tabletop role-playing game with dice and paper, empowering generations of imaginative kids to go on imaginary adventures together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He once described the game like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;The essence of a role-playing game is that it is a group, cooperative experience. There is no winning or losing, but rather the value is in the experience of imagining yourself as a character in whatever genre you&rsquo;re involved in, whether it&rsquo;s a fantasy game, the Wild West, secret agents or whatever else.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>That same ethos applies to 8th Mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| Every Story Is an Invitation |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at 8th Mind, everyone is welcome and everyone will be able to imagine new characters, art, landscapes, or stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every single piece of content on our site is an invitation to create something new: whether you draw a picture, describe a character, write a story, or even make a Snapchat video.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need any special skills to participate.

To make that kid want to leave the world a better place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this is where storytellers can meet and have a chance to plant those seeds and let them grow. Consider it a garden of imagination and ideas, a place where you can cultivate your characters and your designs and the souls of your stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will be an online environment that will seek to build bridges instead of walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://orig05.deviantart.net/e481/f/2017/249/b/b/td_transformers_robert_zuckerman_by_marioluevanos-dbmlsie.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><small>8th Mind Founder Tom DeSanto</small></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| Future Creators |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine if J.K. Rowling was just writing Harry Potter today. She could still be writing at her local coffee shop, but instead of submitting to publishers, she might have posted the first chapter online to get feedback from voices all around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to create an environment where 8th Mind would be her first stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means an environment where an artist can share their work. A place where we always treat each other the way we would want to be treated. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t criticize, but that criticism has to be constructive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| The Rules |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So here are the rules: no acting like a bully, plain and simple. We all know what that means. Because I hate bullies. Treat 8th Mind like a school, like Xavier&rsquo;s or Hogwarts. If you wouldn&rsquo;t act that way at school, then don&rsquo;t do it here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens to bullies at school? They get sent to the principal&#39;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Professor Charles Xavier of 8th Mind, I will punish as I see fit. There will be detentions, suspensions, and expulsions. It is too early to get into the details on that, but creators should know they will be treated with respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes a huge amount of courage to share your art with the world. Know that 8th Mind will be a protected environment, and its foundation will be in respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s go play in the sandbox together and create art that would make Michelangelo proud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And don&rsquo;t ever be afraid that your story or concept art or cartoon is not good enough to share, because it is. That&rsquo;s how artists grow, by putting their soul out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be afraid of the fear that stifles creativity. It has already suffocated an untold number of amazing artists who did not let their artistic voice grow. How many Michelangelo&#39;s, Shakespeares, Picassos or Norman Rockwells could there have been if that human soul had just let their art grow?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img05.deviantart.net/2825/i/2017/249/e/f/xmen_1_by_marioluevanos-dbmlshy.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><small>&nbsp;Kevin Feige, Tom DeSanto, Ian McKellen, and Bryan Singer&nbsp;in front of Statue of Liberty.</small></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| Share It! |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to let that art grow is to share it. So even if you can&rsquo;t afford to move to Hollywood or NYC, you can share your voice and art now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your art and voice starts to take root in the hearts of the audience, then we will be there to help you take your vision to the next level. That may be in the form of a motion comic or animation or maybe even a film or television show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the opportunity is always there and the door is always open. All you need to do is walk through it and share your Harry Potter or Spider-Man with the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So stop reading and go create!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Tom DeSanto</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><small><em>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/7e2pe9wjL9M?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Riccardo Annandale</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></em></small></strong></p>\r\n','c4a4ddb8efe0930b1d6fb7a3f806c38d.jpg','2017-09-05','2075-09-05','No','Photo','No','2017-09-07','Yes','Yes','Article','Active',39,'','2017-09-06 04:53:39','2017-09-08 18:38:26'),(23,'8th Mind Introduction from Founder Tom DeSanto: Part One','<p>Hey everyone! Let me introduce myself to anyone who does not know me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Tom DeSanto, and I am a writer and producer. I was lucky enough to have been a part of bringing three projects I have wanted to do since I was a kid to the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the proud owner of now over 40,000 comic books, making an <em>X-Men</em> film was a dream for me. It took over four years from the time I wrote the treatment until we were in theaters. During those four years, we weathered being shut down, Marvel going bankrupt, the studio telling us to cut $20 million out of the budget, and comic book movies becoming box office poison after <em>Batman and Robin</em> lost $100 million for Warner Bros..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, I never lost faith in the power of the storytelling in <em>X-Men</em>. I was glad to be part of the rebirth of Marvel, spreading the love of comic books to a new generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img10.deviantart.net/18a4/i/2017/249/1/6/tom_hugh_days_of_future_past_bryan_singer_by_marioluevanos-dbmlsib.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><small>8th Mind Founder Tom DeSanto and Hugh Jackman (photo via Bryan Singer)</small></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| Revisiting Battlestar Galactica |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After <em>X-Men</em>, I pulled <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> out of mothballs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although my version of the show did not become fully realized, there are elements in the script we had and our visual effects tests and concept art which did make it into the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ron Moore took the reins and did an amazing job going beyond just a contrived science-fiction show.

I will leave the story of the journey of <em>Transformers</em> for another time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first <em>Transformers</em> film, <em>X-Men</em>, and <em>X-Men 2 </em>are the films I am most proud of in my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three of those stories have something in common: they sparked the imagination of a kid in New Jersey to dream beyond the four rooms of an apartment and helped him see visions of spaceships and superheroes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They pushed that child to be a better soul and unlock his inner hero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is what we hope to do with 8th Mind.

But fans have expanded that colorful universe with fan fiction, fan art, and other creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overarching plot of the Ninjago universe centers around a team of ninjas who have mastered control of earthly elements such as fire and ice. They struggle to stop the evil Lord Garmadon from taking over the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These ninjas receive guidance and training from their sensei, Wu. In a family twist worthy of Shakespeare, Wu just so happens to be Lord Garmadon&rsquo;s brother.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| The LEGO Legacy |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Following this storyline, the Ninjago animated television series has run for seven seasons (and is gearing up for an eighth). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 22, the team behind <em>The LEGO Movie</em> and <em>The LEGO Batman Movie</em> will bring <em>The LEGO Ninjago Movie</em> to theaters around the country--using their signature&nbsp;stop motion animation style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the popular TV show and upcoming movie from professional creators, fans have been making Ninjago stories for years. The brand has inspired artists, stop-motion animators, video makers, and writers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many LEGO creatives began as fans, their imagination sparked by playing with other fans. In the <em>LEGO NINJAGO Character Encyclopedia</em>, LEGO senior creative director Simon Lucas recalled:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was definitely a LEGO kid! The biggest memory for me is of LEGO Pirates sets in the late 1980s and also the LEGO space sets. I also remember buying LEGO Technic sets, which taught me a lot about engineering and how mechanisms work.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucas&rsquo;s job is to oversee all aspects of the Ninjago universe, working with talented creatives on every side of the brand: including model designers, animators, writers, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While creating villains for Ninjago, he used the pirates he used to play with as a kid. As a professional creator, he also twisted the pirate storyline to surprise fans who are creating their own narratives. He explained:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;For NINJAGO bad guys, we always want to create cool characters with a twist. For 2016, we started with something as iconic and classic as pirates and then gave it a NINJAGO fantasy twist by taking the pirates to the skies to create NINJAGO Sky Pirates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>| Building Your Own Story |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the central appeal behind LEGO as a whole is that once you have a set and you put it together, you can then deconstruct it and use the bricks to create whatever you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that creative freedom at the core of LEGO, it&rsquo;s no surprise that Ninjago fans have been creating their own completely unique sets, artwork, and storylines since it was first introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll find homemade Ninjago movies with millions of views on YouTube, plus tens of thousands of works of fan art and fanfiction on sites like WattPad and DeviantArt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably the most notable example of a fan-made LEGO Ninjago film, the channel MadAboutLEGO created a stop-motion film that follows the ninja team&rsquo;s quest to awaken the Golden Mech for a final fight against evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nriozA9_tb0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>CooperAce productions also makes stop-motion Ninjago videos. The popular channel now has over a hundred millions views in total.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBZ2-f1v9ug\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>DTinaglia Studios uploads Ninjago videos weekly while the TV show airs. Just like the other channels,&nbsp;the creator has a lo-fi, fun aesthetic that keeps their legions of fans coming back.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| Fan Art &amp; Fan Fiction |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dozens of Ninjago fan groups and thousands of artists have created breathtaking fan art based on this world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/8thMind/lego-ninjago-fan-art/\">We created a special Pinterest board collecting a few of our favorites.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the community writing site Wattpad, <a href=\"http://www.wattpad.com/search/lego%20ninjago\">Ninjago-based writings</a> routinely rack up thousands of readers. Many of the stories are short scenarios or one-shots, and they are often centered around romances between the Ninjago ninjas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible to overstate the affection Ninjago&rsquo;s fans have for these stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They not only support and bolster the TV show and LEGO sets, they made it possible for the Ninjago world to come to the big screen in a major production. But what&rsquo;s truly amazing is the degree to which Ninjago fans engage with the world and make their own creations based on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LEGO is special because&nbsp;it invites fans to take part in the story&nbsp;and to use LEGO&nbsp;to tell their own stories. Ninjago is a big open universe, and that has led to a truly staggering amount of fan-driven world building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That kind of engagement will inspire the professional writers and creatives at LEGO to keep creating great Ninjago content. It also gets the fans involved and helps them to make their own creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someday, these young fans will be creating new LEGO worlds for the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| The 8th Mind Sandbox |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to visit &ldquo;The 8th Mind Sandbox,&rdquo; a space for community conversation and sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sandbox discussion is open to writers, artists, and all other kinds of creators.

Many creators do, at least on paper!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Magic, by its very nature, is a mysterious aspect of storytelling. It can be used to create conflict, to fight battles, gain information, and just about anything you&rsquo;d like to use it for. As a world builder, it&rsquo;s important to know how the magical system in your world operates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Robert Jordan&rsquo;s <em>Eye of the World</em> books, for instance, magic comes from a specific, well-defined source. Accessing it is something people are either born with or not, but controlling it requires a great deal of training and practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, the use of magic is somewhat more ambiguous, but Tolkien was still careful to put limits on what using it could and could not accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/8thMind/the-use-of-magic/\">Here&#39;s a gallery of magical inspiration that we assembled...</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a data-pin-do=\"embedBoard\" data-pin-board-width=\"700\" data-pin-scale-height=\"500\" data-pin-scale-width=\"400\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/8thMind/the-use-of-magic/\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| More Magic |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Creators are working on magical systems all the time. Here are some inspiring examples recently submitted by users from the WorldBuilding subreddit&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One world-builder treats magic like any other discipline you could master <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/67dcdm/tell_me_about_the_origin_of_your_worlds_magic/dgpk3n0/?st=j68eu0qo&amp;sh=c6b35fab\">with enough study</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In my world magic is a learned science. &hellip; It&#39;s something that anybody could theoretically learn, if they have enough time and money ... Some people suck at math, others suck at writing, and then there are those who just suck at magic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Improper magic <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/41o097/fantasy_writers_what_are_the_dangers_of_magic_use/\">can make you very sick</a> in another creator&#39;s world:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;one of the primary dangers of being in close proximity to or handling high concentrations of [magic]: Random mistakes and mutations during cell division. Or, to put it more simply: Cancer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, one world-builder <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/67dcdm/tell_me_about_the_origin_of_your_worlds_magic/dgplj6g/\">created a limit to magic use</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Channeling depends on an &lsquo;ethereal&rsquo; organ that encompasses your body. Channeling strains it, and if you strain it too much, you feel like burning, and it can reach a breaking point, in which case, you die. Horribly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>But today, we want to know how magic works in the world you&rsquo;re building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>| The 8th Mind Sandbox |</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to visit &ldquo;The 8th Mind Sandbox,&rdquo; a space for community conversation and sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sandbox discussion is open to writers, artists, and all other kinds of creators.

A Kamikaze will, of course, sacrifice himself to do maximum damage, clearing out an entire area of baddies with a smile on his face. Nomads are just beasts of punishment, but their drawback is if they get killed, they&#39;ll come back from the dead and join the other side of the battle (so let&#39;s keep him protected just to be safe).

Could skewer several monsters at a time and clear away groups by sending them flying. Nina Cogen - extremely powerful magician. Has mastered advanced techniques to maximize her usefulness in battle (magic is pretty slow in my world). Also incredibly intelligent so she&#39;d probably find some way to slow the monsters down Skorm - former God of Shadows. Has an entire network of lost souls powering him and an army of skeletons/undead behind him although their usefulness would probably be limited against these monsters. Flange - an ungodly abomination created by Skorm. This is the one you want for maximum damage.

Read science magazines.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&#39;s a lot of great science journalism on the internet that&#39;s free that you can find out there that are aimed at just regular people who are interested in science, but who don&#39;t have like a fancy degree.&quot; A few examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/\">New Scientist </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/\">Science Magazine </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/\">Popular Science</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/\">Popular Mechanics</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.archaeology.org/\">Archeology Magazine </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/\">Sky &amp; Telescope Magazine</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://makezine.com/\">Make: Magazine</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Consult Wikipedia &amp; then expand.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Go online and start with Wikipedia. But don&#39;t stop with Wikipedia! That&rsquo;s my real piece of advice. Wikipedia is a great place to start, but the best thing to read and then scroll down to the bottom and look at all of the links. Then go to those places and learn more from the books and articles that have been linked to there.&rdquo; That&#39;s where you&#39;re really going to find out the cool stuff. Wikipedia is a little tiny glimpse. What you really want to find is at the end.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Visit your local library.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Libraries are your friend! You can go to your library and you can say &lsquo;I want to learn about how planets orbit a star,&rsquo; and there are a lot of books to help you understand that. So spend a day at the library asking your librarian, reading books, and using the computers at your library. People forget that. Because libraries seem like they&#39;re from another dimension. Which they are. They&#39;re from the awesome dimension!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Make a simple timeline of how the world will change.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;[In my document] I literally just like wrote down [the next 150 years]. I mostly went by decade.

Most of his race gone to ground after their near extinction following the Cataclysm, a magical event that split apart continents and cast humans and spirits alike to the four winds.In this world, spirits are the caretakers of magic, and only they can access it and harness its power. Quinn and Aonair hope that by gathering the remaining spirits, they can convince them to use their power to help heal their ailing world.&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, the composer and world-builder imagines The Cartographer as a game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the musical and other multimedia elements, it would be too limited as a book. &quot;I feel like games are the only medium that you can truly explore in,&quot; he explains. &quot;The likelihood of that ever happening is miniscule, but I can dream!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more, 8th Mind caught up with Markey for an interview...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8th Mind: </strong>What inspired you to get started with musical world-building? How did <em>The Cartographer</em> project develop?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nolan Markey: </strong>I actually started out when I was an undergrad composition major.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.conceptart.org/go/learn/\">ConceptArt</a>&nbsp;used to have a bunch of really cool weekly competitions like Environment of the Week, Character of the Week, etc.&nbsp; Oftentimes the artists would post short little vignettes with the art, which was kind of like creative rocket fuel for me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really wanted to explore the world they created in my own way - through writing music. The Cartographer started as a bunch of random scribblings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to create a story and a setting that was optimistic and expressed what I consider to be the better parts of human nature - our desire to explore, to help others, and to better ourselves (big <em>Star Trek</em> fan, if you haven&#39;t noticed).&nbsp; It was also nice to have something that was entirely my own.&nbsp; When a project is that personal, it becomes incredibly fun to work on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8th Mind:</strong> What are all the tools do you use for creating all these pieces?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nolan Markey: </strong> I have quite the toolbox.&nbsp; My day job is as a composer and orchestrator, so I&#39;ve spent some serious time and money investing into my studio.&nbsp; I&#39;m running Logic Pro off of two monstrous Mac Pros, with probably about 4 terabytes of sample libraries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of my music is done through programming samples, but I always try to have live musicians play.&nbsp; On &quot;River Spirit&quot;, for example, I had a fiddle player, a flutist, a horn player, and I played trumpet and recorded vocals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8th Mind:</strong> For someone just getting started, what are the basic tools they need?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nolan Markey: </strong> All you really need is a pencil and a sheet of paper, or a piano, or a cheap keyboard.&nbsp; Everything else is just shine and polish.&nbsp; A great idea is a great idea, no matter the medium.&nbsp; It&#39;s also nice that every human has a built-in instrument - your voice.&nbsp; There are infinite ways to get started with making music without spending tons of money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8th Mind: </strong>Have you found other musical world-builders? Do you think it could grow into a bigger community?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;d consider any composer who writes for film, games, or television a musical world-builder at heart.&nbsp; They&#39;re just helping other people realize their worlds.&nbsp; Imagine Star Wars without music!&nbsp; It&#39;s as much a part of the world as Wookies of Jedi.&nbsp; But as far as musicians building their own little worlds, I haven&#39;t really run into any others.&nbsp; I certainly think that there&#39;s room to grow, as long as there&#39;s an audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/6mXWOm43zZg?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Radek Grzybowski</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>\r\n','925e93e40f169fff4f5d5794da9f4e46.jpg','2017-09-21','2189-10-26','No','Photo','No','2017-09-26','Yes','Yes','Article','Disable',39,'','2017-09-21 05:08:09','2017-09-21 05:08:32');
